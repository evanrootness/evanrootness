### Hi!

I'm Evan Rootness, a senior at the University of Michigan (2025) pursuing a Honors B.S. in Astronomy and B.S. in Physics. I'm interested in applying the quantitative skills and coding experience I have to a career in data.

Right now I'm improving my programming skills and learning new concepts related to machine learning, data wrangling, and visualizations.

Outside of academics, one hobby I really enjoy is making art. I actually have a project related to that which you should go check out! (EtsyDSProject)
